# Ensayo1
VROPE is an e-commerce owned by two brothers from the city of Cordoba, Argentina. The design of the website was a team effort with the client.
This mockup was one of the ones used in his presentation.

(This project was done in my first months as a programmer as a result of a student internship at the institute).
